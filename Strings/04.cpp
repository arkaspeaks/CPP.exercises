// Access the first character (H) in myString and print the result:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
    string a = "Hello";
    cout << "the first character in the string is: "<< a[0] <<endl;
    return 0;
}

//remember the first character always starts with 0, then 1 , 2 and eventually moves on
